# Security Policy

The security of StarryBio is our top priority. We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the community to help keep our project safe. If you discover a security vulnerability, we encourage you to report it to us privately following the guidelines below.

## Supported Versions

StarryBio is a template-based project rather than a versioned software package. Security updates and patches are applied directly to the `main` branch. We always support the latest version of the code available in the main repository.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| Latest `main` branch | :white_check_mark: |
| All previous versions | :x:                |

Users are encouraged to pull the latest changes from the `main` branch to ensure they have the most secure and up-to-date version of the template.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do **not** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

### **Preferred Method: GitHub Private Vulnerability Report**
